### Hello there 👋

#### A Entrepreneur/Developer by day/night ☼ and Batman by overnight ☾

Dropout high school to start my first business – Helped other experts sell their online courses. We did over R$400k ($75k) in revenue within 3 months – that’s when I started using product development to help me work better.

Worked with several companies as a React developer, then shifted to no-code. After the AI revolution, I went back to code + n8n. Today, I’m working at a SaaS doing $40k/mo in revenue (that I build solo in 2 weeks).

And I've got 2 other side projects in currently development...👀.

- ⚙️ I use daily: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.n8n`, `.supabase`, `.bubble.io`
- 🌐 On Instagram I help juniors land their first job [@ogabarbosa](https://instagram.com/ogabarbosa)
- 💬 `ping` me about **design**, **no-code**, **ai**, **development**, **automation**, **n8n**, **supabase**
